Hi!

I'm a frontend developer based in Orange County, California. By day I'm a web developer building web tools and visualizing big (and small) data. By night I'm a tinkerer who feels quite content when things don't explode. Give me good friends and good food, and I'm good to go.

Tweet me [@yonester](http://twitter.com/yonester), say hi via [email](mailto:yonester@gmail.com), or find my CV on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yonester).

Have a nice day **:)**
